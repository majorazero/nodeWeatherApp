# nodeWeatherApp

This was made so I can learn how to call API's (in this case from the OpenWeatherMap website) and get some practice with using the request module. Also going to practice writing documentation.

# Getting Started
- Install git
    - Installation Guide for [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- Install nodeJS
    - Here's a guide for the [Windows Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
    - Here's a guide for the [Mac Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
- Go to the command line and navigate to the folder you either cloned or downloaded
    - `cd yourFolderName`
- Run `npm install`
    - That should download all the dependencies.

# Running the App
- The entire app actually works through the console.
    - Just call `node main.js -c "city name"` and the console should output the temperature in Imperial Units back to you of the city you chose.
